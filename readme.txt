Say we have a file we want users to authenticate. The hash is generated by hashing the last block, appending the hash to the
second last block, hashing the augmented second last block, then appending this
hash to the third last block and so on. The hash function is assumed to be
collision resistant. The hash h0 of the first augmented block is then distributed to
users.

The file authentication system can then authenticate an unknown file block
by block.(so it doesn't have to wait for the entire file) First it verifies that
the hash of the first augmented block is h0. Then the hash of the second
augmented is checked against h1, which we have from the first augmented block.
